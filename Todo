1)
Option 1: Apply hue mask for purple to find liver
	Intersect with current tumor elipse (green) for respective image
Option 2: Detect liver by searching for Purple Hue. Mask the rest of the image(by uncommenting code in tumor detection)
	Then find green in the masked image.


Problem with (1) - We dont know how to do the intersection

2) We need code to calculate area of elipse and then find volume, % of tumor etc


Questions to be asked: 

1) Which option is better?
2) Is the amount error acceptable?
3) Number of samples?
4) Sample step size?
5) pic 7 - 19 has liver. Rest samples are useless. Do we require these?
6) How should the final report be?
7) Tips on final PPT for current progress
